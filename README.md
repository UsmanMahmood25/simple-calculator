# Simple Calculator

## Introduction

Welcome to the Simple Calculator. This calculator is designed to function as any other simple calculator would, however this can only function via voice command. The way this works is the user is greeted with the standard introduction and prompted to use the calculator. All the user needs to do is speak into their microphone and the calculator will calcualte what the user asked for (Note: This is a basic calculator capable of solving BEDMAS equations (minus the B)). The purpose of this mini project was to utilze the speech-to-text and text-to-speech and have the results of such a command perform something. This is the first time I have incorpeated such a feature and so decided to test it with a calculator.

## Important

When asking the question, make sure the equation consists of mathematical symbols, meaning should the user attempt to find the answer to 2^2, the equation should be heard as "2 ^ 2" and NOT "2 squared". The calculator will relay the message that you said to verify if what you said was correct. Note: when the calculator does relay the message, some of the characters the calculator might say wont reflect what is shown on screen. For exmaple, went wanting to subtract/minus, the calcuator with say "to" for the symbol "-". This is due to the audio driver of the system (I have not yet found a workaround for this).

### Aditional Note

This mini project is still a work in progress. Current Status ==> Operational
